step 1:start
step 2:delcare  the variables sum,count
step 3:assing the values count=1,sum=0,
step 4:check if the count value is divisible by 2 or not(count%2==0). if it is divisible by 2 
step 5:sum=sum+count
step 6:count=count+1
step 7:print sum
step 8:repeatedly the step(4) to (7) until it reaches the count value less than  or equal to 20(count<=20)
