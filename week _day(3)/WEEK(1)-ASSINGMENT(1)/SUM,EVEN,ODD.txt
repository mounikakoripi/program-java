=write an alogithm sum of 1 to 100 numbers?
step 1:start
step 2:delecare the count,sum
step 3:assing the value 1 to count,sum=0
step 4:sum=sum+count
step 5:increment count value by 1 and store the value into count(count<--count+1)
step 6:repeat the steps4 and step 5 until it  reach count value is lessthan or equal to(count<=10)
step 7: print sum
step 8:stop




write an alogrithm to find 1 to 100 even numbers
step 1:start
step 2:declare number n,
step 3:repeatedly the steps(4) to step(5)
         until(n<=100)
step 4:n=n+1
step 5:if(n%2==0)
step 6:print " even numbers"
step 7:stop

1 to 100 even numbers?

step1:start
step2:declare count variable
step3:assigning the value 1 into count
step4:check if the count value is divisible by 2 or not(count%2==0). if it is divisible by 2 goto step5 otherwise goto step6
step5:print count
step6:increment the count value by 1 (count=count+1)
step7:repeat the step 4,5,6 until it reaches the count value lessthan or equal to 100 (count<=100)
step8:stop
